romaji-cpp
==========

This is a small C++ library and accompanying driver program which
transliterates UTF-8 strings of kana (Japanese phonetic characters) into romaji
(Latin letters). Special care was taken to handle all variety of inputs,
including some exotic edge cases.

The driver program `kana_to_romaji` is a command-line tool which converts its
argument from a UTF-8 encoded string of kana into romaji on `stdout`. It is built
with

	make

or

	make kana_to_romaji

To build the driver program and perform unit tests, use

	make test
